Rust Game Project TODOs
=======================

Learning Rust on Windows
	- Download/write Rust hello world
	* Import a crate to do anything
	- Set the crate to a specific version
	- Write unittestable code segment (anagram)
	- Unittest code segment

Learning Bevy
	- Download completed Rust game project to prove compilation with Bevy
	- Implement Bevy's hello world
	* See other Bevy tutorials for examples on specific implementations

Project Setup
	+ Setup a gitrepo of the project
	+ Clone the README down
	- Implement hello world into the repo as a placeholder
	* Setup cargo to use consistent toolchains within the repo (Bevy uses nightly?)

Project Planning
	- Using what you know about Bevy now, plan achievable goals like:
		- Make a grid
		- Make a shape on the grid
		- Make the shape move
		- Make the shape pickup and drop other shapes on the same square using ECS methodologies
